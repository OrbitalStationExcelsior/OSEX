The Orbital Station Excelsior is a new project on Binance Smart Chain.
This project is allowed to obtain benefits of all holders, and is also set to interact with the community. 
The Orbital Station Excelsior will allow participants to choose the direction of the project.
Our beginning includes many opportunities for a crypto project to come into contact with the real world.
For example: 1% of each transaction will go to a special charity wallet. 
Cash income received from this wallet will be sent to charitable projects around the world (rescue funds, volunteer organizations, 
international movements for the protection of nature, etc). We guarantee to provide reports and proofs of our activities.
